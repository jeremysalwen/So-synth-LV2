SO-666 v.1.0 by 50m30n3 2009
LV2 port by Jeremy Salwen 2010

SO-666 is a feedback based drone synthesizer building upon the SO-KL5 synth.
It creates haunting cacophonic howls and drones.
It's a bit hard to play but making good use of the modwheel will help keep the
sound in control.

To run the synth you need Jack and ALSA. You can set a different midi channel
by starting the program using the channel number as argument. The default
channel is zero.

All synthesis parameters can be edited using MIDI CC messages.

Parameter list:
CC#1	-	Feedback (mod wheel)
CC#7	-	Volume
CC#71	-	Filter Resonance
CC#74	-	Filter Cutoff

To compile the code you need the ALSA and Jack developement files.

SO-KL5 v.1.1 by 50m30n3 2010

SO-KL5 is a string based "piano" synthezizer. The strings are
modeled using the Karplus-Strong String simulation method.

Parameter list:
CC#1	-	Sustain
CC#7	-	Volume
CC#64	-	Sustain
CC#71	-	Filter Resonance
CC#74	-	Filter Cutoff

Sustain can be controlled by CC#1 (Mod Wheel) and CC#64 (Sustain) to make
control easier for people without a sustain pedal.
